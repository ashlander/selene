# Selene

## Documentation

**Selene** is (almost) fully documented using the [_Doxygen_](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) format.
_Doxygen_ documentation can be built using the provided `Doxyfile`.
Simply run `doxygen` in the main library directory.

* A regularly updated version of the API reference documentation [is hosted here](https://selene-lib.org/docs/).

## Example code

Commented example code for select functionality can be found in the [`examples` folder of the repository](../examples).

These examples can serve as a tutorial, and are probably the easiest starting point to get to know important parts of
the library.
